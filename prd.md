Product Name: PhraseLightyear（片語光年）

Visual Style:
Modern poetic design with a clean aesthetic. Inspired by literature zines and reading-focused apps. Use serif body fonts (like 'Merriweather') and soft UI with card-based layout. Design evokes stillness and reflection, ideal for readers who enjoy thoughtful experiences. Vite + React with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and mobile-first responsive design.

Core Features:
1. Book Summary Feed: Display a curated list of book summaries with title, author, and poetic excerpt. Styled like Kobo but in a slower, more reflective layout.
2. Reader Insights: Each book page includes user-contributed reflections styled as short, contemplative essays.
3. Suggestion Pool: A section where readers can write suggestions for similar reads or comment on the impact of a book.
4. Bookmark without Login: Readers can save any book/reflection for later review without account creation.
5. Filter by Mood/Theme: Allow filtering of books based on tone (e.g., nostalgic, empowering, tragic).
6. Mobile-First Design: Thoughtfully stacked layout and flowing typography for a comfortable mobile reading experience.
